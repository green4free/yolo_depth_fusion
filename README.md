#yolo_depth_fusion
This is a ROS node that takes data from [darknet_ros](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros) and [zed-ros-wrapper](https://github.com/stereolabs/zed-ros-wrapper) and fuses it. So that each object found by the YOLO algorithm running on darknet is bundled with the distance to it. 

Developed during the course CDT406 at MÃ¤lardalen University in a project to help blind people navigate using a vision system. [https://github.com/byteofsoren/blind_navi](https://github.com/byteofsoren/blind_navi)

##Limitations and status:
